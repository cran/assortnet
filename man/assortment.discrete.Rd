\title{
Assortment on discrete vertex values
}
\description{
Calculates the assortativity coefficient for weighted and unweighted graphs with nominal/categorical vertex values
}
\usage{
assortment.discrete(graph, types, weighted = TRUE, SE = FALSE, M = 1, na.rm = FALSE)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{graph}{
  	Adjacency matrix, as an N x N matrix.  Can be weighted or binary.
}
  \item{types}{
	Values on which to calculate assortment, vector of N labels
}
  \item{weighted}{
	Flag: TRUE to use weighted edges, FALSE to turn edges into binary (even if weights are given)
}
  \item{SE}{
	Calculate standard error using the Jackknife method.
}
  \item{M}{
	Binning value for Jackknife, where M edges are removed rather than single edges.  This helps speed up the estimate for large networks with many edges.
}
  \item{na.rm}{
	Remove all nodes which have NA as type from both the network and the types object. If this is False and NAs are present, an error message will be displayed.
}
}
\value{
	This function returns a named list, with three elements:
	
	$r the assortativity coefficient
	$SE the standard error
	$mixing_matrix the mixing matrix with the distribution of edges or edge weights by category
}
